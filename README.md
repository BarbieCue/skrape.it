[skrape{it}](https://docs.skrape.it)
====================================

_**[skrape{it}](http://www.skrape.it)**_ is a Kotlin-based HTML/XML testing and web scraping library
that can be used seamlessly in Spring-Boot, Ktor, Android or other Kotlin-JVM projects.
The ability to analyze and extract HTML including client-side rendered DOM trees and all other XML-related markup specifications such as SVG, UML, RSS,... makes it unique.
It places particular emphasis on ease of use and a high level of readability by providing an intuitive DSL.
First and foremost skrape{it} aims to be a testing tool (not tied to a particular test runner), but it can also be used to scrape websites in a convenient fashion.

## Features
- [x] Deserialization of HTML/XML from websites, local html files and html as string to data classes / POJOs.
- [x] Http-Client without verbosity and ceremony to make requests and corresponding request options like headers, cookies etc in a fluent style interface.
- [x] Can handle client side rendered webpages / Javascript execution
- [x] Designed to deserialize HTML but can handle any XML-related markup specifications such as SVG, UML, RSS or XML itself.
- [x] Easy to use, idiomatic and type-safe DSL to ensure a high level of readability.
- [x] DSL to select html elements as well as supporting CSS query-selector syntax.
- [x] Not bind to a specific test runner or framework.
- [x] Build-in matchers/assertions based on infix functions to archive a very high level of readability.
- [x] Open to use any other assertion library of your choice.
- [x] DSL is behaving like a Fluent-Api to make data extraction/scraping as comfortable as possible.

### Coming Soon
- [x] Pre-configure client regarding auth and other request settings 
- [x] Asynchronous and blocking requests
- [x] Requests as [coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)
- [x] Cancel asynchronous request
- [x] Store to file

#### Extensions
In addition, extensions for well-known testing libraries are provided to extend them with the mentioned skrape{it} functionality.
Currently available:
* [Skrape{it} MockMvc extension](https://github.com/skrapeit/skrapeit-mockmvc-extension)
* [Skrape{it} Ktor extension](https://github.com/skrapeit/skrapeit-ktor-extension)

### Quick Start

```java
@Test
internal fun `dsl can skrape by url`() {
    skrape {
        url = "http://localhost:8080/example"
        
        mode = DOM // optional -> defaults to SOURCE (plain http request) - DOM will also render JS
        method = GET // optional -> defaults to GET
        timeout = 5000 // optional -> defaults to 5000ms
        followRedirects = true // optional -> defaults to true
        userAgent = "some custom user agent" // optional -> defaults to "Mozilla/5.0 skrape.it"
        cookies = mapOf("some-cookie-name" to "some-value") // optional
        headers = mapOf("some-custom-header" to "some-value") // optional
        
        extract {
            htmlDocument {
                // all offical html and html5 elements are supported by the DSL
                div {
                    withClass = "foo" and "bar" and "fizz" and "buzz"

                    findFirst {
                        text() toBe "div with class foo"
                    }

                    findAll {
                        toBePresentExactlyOnce()
                    }
                }
                // can handle custom tags as well
                "a-custom-tag" {
                    findFirst {
                        text() toBe "i'm a custom html5 tag"
                        text()
                    }
                }
                // can handle custom tags written in css selctor query syntax
                "div.foo.bar.fizz.buzz" {
                    findFirst {
                        text() toBe "div with class foo"
                    }
                }

                // can handle custom tags and add selector specificas via DSL
                "div.foo" {

                    withClass = "bar" and "fizz" and "buzz"

                    findFirst {
                        text() toBe "div with class foo"
                    }
